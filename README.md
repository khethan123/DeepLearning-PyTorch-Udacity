# Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch - Udacity Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for Udacity's [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud188) course.

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework. It covers the basics of PyTorch, how to define and train both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and how to use new features for deploying models.

## Topics Covered

- Basics of PyTorch
- Defining and training CNNs
- Defining and training RNNs
- Deploying models using PyTorch
- Using PyTorch for Production
